# **What is DID?**

DID refers to a new type of identity that is completely controlled by the owner without any centralized third-party involvement, meaning that any information about your identity is completely in your own hands and no one can access it without your permission.


## **DID in Chia**

The DID is used to support on-chain identity proofing. The holder of a Chia DID can be any entity, such as an individual, a company, an electronic device, etc. The Chia DID can be associated with the holder's wallet, the NFT markets or other aspects of the Chia ecosystem. DIDs are stored on Chia's decentralized blockchain, which is also programmable, transferable, recoverable and discoverable. Anyone using the Chia blockchain can create a Chia DID to represent themselves or their organization.Every person, institutional organization should have full control over their identifier information. This includes data ownership, deciding what information about the identifier is shared and with whom. Unfortunately, we live in a world where personal information is often shared without the owner's knowledge or permission. Now Chia DID is trying to solve this issue.

Chia DID solves all of these shortcomings:
No central certification authority is required to issue it, and Chia DIDs are not controlled by anyone other than their owners
The owner has full control over the information contained in the identity, including any private information. This identity information cannot be shared without the owner's permission

The identity cannot be destroyed without the owner's permission
They will not be destroyed as long as the Chia blockchain is functioning properly
Chia DIDs are recognized by different companies or entities



## **How to verify DID on Spacescan.io?**

All creators who publish nft on Chia will need to verify their DID. Why is it important? 1) The validity of the creator's DID is verified through the blockchain, in other words whether the work is a counterfeit or not. 2) Whether the owner calls the NFT to another wallet of his own through a decentralized wallet to prevent tracking. The creator of the NFT on the Chia chain can choose to attach a DID (Decentralized ID) of his own, and the buyer can easily find and verify the history related to this NFT, including the author, the owner and the amount of the transaction, at any time.
