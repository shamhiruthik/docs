## About Me

I am a Highly Energetic, Ambitious and Hard Working person. I like learning and working on creative projects as a team. My hobbies include Singing, playing Guitar and Travelling. I've been into making Games since 2020 on Unity. It has been a great coding journey so far. It used to itch my hands hard. Now, I've got a new passion in Blockchain Technology. Looking forward to working with Chia :)

## Excited to work as an Intern

Life has been adventurous for me. Being my first internship, this opportunity marks a new chapter in my life. I'm looking forward to working and solving challenging issues of spacescan.io.
