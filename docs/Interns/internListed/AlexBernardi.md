# Alex Bernardi - United States
## About Me
Hello everyone. My name is Alex Bernardi. I am finishing up by BA in Arabic regional studies. I attended the Defense Language Institute basic and intermediate Arabic course (levantine and MSA) as an airmen in the USAF. While overseas, I discovered firsthand the importance of using large data sets to increase our intelligence capabilities. It was at this moment I decided to switch from being a linguist to pursuing a masters in data science. Currently, I'm helping develop spacescan.io in reactJs, html, css, and node.js.


## My experience in Chia
I discovered chia in early 2021 when they released their Business Whitepaper. I was hooked on many of the concepts that were mentioned, especially the PoST protocol. My interest being peaked, I joined the chia keybase and started reading the chat. A month later I was building plotters and getting my hands on any cheap HDD's I could find. Through this endeavour, I learned a great deal about how to scale my farm, deal with power issues, and optimize plotter size to farm size. I have always wanted to join the Chia development ecosystem and I've been able to through spacescans internship and mentorship program.
 
## What I'm expecting in this Intern-2022 PROGRAM
I'm looking forward to learning how to work with a worldwide team of developers. I hope to gain real world experience in web development and how to work with large datasets. This also gives me the perfect excuse to start learning ChiaLisp and contribute to the Chia ecosystem.
