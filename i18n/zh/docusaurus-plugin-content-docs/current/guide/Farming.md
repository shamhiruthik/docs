# Farming

**Terminology**

Mining is the exchange of labor and time for material resources, so it is a perfect analogy to the process in proof-of-work where miners are constantly using large amounts of power to compete for block rewards. chia decided to adopt a completely different terminology to better describe how the protocol works. Here are some terminology you should know.

Plotting - Creating a proof of a space into a "plot file" requires a one-time use of computational resources in advance so that the proof can be quickly and easily verified later."Planting the Seed"

Harvesting - Harvesting is a farmer-controlled machine that checks the plot file for proof of space without interruption."Low energy sustained growth"

Farming- Farmers race to create plots when proof of space is found that meets the challenge requirements."Sell crops for money"

Full Node - Maintains a full copy of the blockchain, propagating, trading and proving blocks between counterparties."Delivery Truck"



**Farming efficiency**
Chia's farming is very different. On the one hand, farming uses commodity-level storage hardware, primarily higher-capacity hard disk drives (HDDs). Farming also does not store user data, so it can use storage with a high error rate and low quality hhd. The primary metric for farming is $/TB for storage devices, followed by power efficiency W/TB. Netspace drives, in an efficient market environment, come from underutilized storage drives and reused/recycled, refurbished and used drives because of their lower upfront cost.
