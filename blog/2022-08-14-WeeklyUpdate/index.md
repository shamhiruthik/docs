## Completed

- Jon from [chialinks.com](https://chialinks.com/) created a feature bounty in [Github](https://github.com/spacescan-io/web/issues/54) with [3.14 XCH](https://www.spacescan.io/xch/coin/0x771cde950b235e9513c66a3542865cf70587417adf529be8c42485040e4d4191)  for Rich list and we have added first set of the chart and more charts soon.

### 2. Claim your NFT Creator DID to avoid scams
- If you are Chia NFT creator, claim your DID to avoid any scammers impersonating your collections.

> https://docs.spacescan.io/docs/guide/verifyDID

- Impersonation is becoming a problem in Chia NFT echo system. CHIA DID is offering solution to link NFT collections to DID. DID owner can link it to social accounts to prove the ownership. 
The DID1 is in draft and not ready for two-way link.
- As interim option, created twitter bot which links Minter DID to NFT meta data so the DID could be claimed via twitter.
- Check out DID page of [Space RatZ NFT](https://www.spacescan.io/xch/did/3461dc504bea934aa500f5635ecbd713fc00c84e2d9ba704af120d983a827212)
